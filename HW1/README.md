Write a program that multiplies two matrices given to you in two files whose names will be passed via command line arguments, your program must print out the output matrix in the same format as the matrices in files:

 

matrix1.txt

1 2 1

2 1 2

matrix2.txt

1 3

2 2 

3 1

matrixproduct matrix1.txt matrix2.txt

8    8

10 10

Note any type of space can be used as separator. Must use streams for input output and as much use of C++ as possible, i.e. use of printf instead of cout will result in deductions from grade
