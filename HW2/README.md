1.-Implement the class clock type described in the slides, use the same const modifier for all the methods FOR THE METHODS THAT HAVE THE CONST MODIFIER, the ones that don't DO NOT ADD it.

 

2.-Write a program that creates a clocktype object and calls all the methods. Report the results of compiling and running the program.

 

3.-Write a new program that creates a const clocktype object and invoke all the const methods on it. Report the results of compilation and running the program.

 

4.-Write another program that creates a const cllocktype object and invoke all methods on it (const and non const) report the results of compilation.

 

Include a PDF with listings of all the programs and your class implementation and screenshots of compiling and running the programs.
